myNotes is my attempt to create terminal-based notes tool.
I'll start with using aliases and simple python script.

To make it work you need to add an alias:
>alias note ~/note.py
where ~/note.py is path to python script

Example of usage:
>note + "dupa"
adds note "dupa" to certain file.

toDo functionalities:
>seeing notes
>removing notes
>backup - uploading to the server
>synchronising
>many platforms
